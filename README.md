I created an interactive dashboard to catalog the microbes in human navels. The json dataset used came from a study out of NC State, http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/. 

I used D3 and JavaScript to display a drop down list so the user can select one of the participant's id number. After the id is selected, multiple graphics are created to show that participant's demographics, prevalence of the top 10 organisms, the number of washes per week, as well as a scatter plot that is displays all the microbes present of the subject. 

The github page to find this dashboard at is https://jasoncr.github.io/plotly-challenge/.

Below are examples of the dashboard.
